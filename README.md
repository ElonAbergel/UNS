This repository contains a demo version of **UNS** (Unicorn Super Network) - a proof of concept project aimed at showcasing the potential of decentralized networking. The demo project includes a website called Ywitter, which demonstrates how UNS can facilitate secure communication and interaction in a decentralized network.

## Introduction

UNS is designed to address the limitations of traditional centralized networks by leveraging the principles of decentralization, peer-to-peer connectivity, and blockchain consensus. The project aims to enable seamless communication, data transfer, and resource sharing among network participants while ensuring privacy, security, and censorship resistance.

## Demo

This demo project features a website called Ywitter, which serves as a social media platform running on the UNS network. Ywitter demonstrates the functionality of UNS by enabling secure communication and interaction between users. The demo will showcase the Sybil Authentication mechanism implemented by UNS.
